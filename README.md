# scAnalysis

This repository contains my reproduction of the analyses performed by Kharchenko & Adameyko _et al._, published in **Nature Genetics** (2021). The original study, titled _Single-cell transcriptomics of human embryos identifies multiple sympathoblast lineages with potential implications for neuroblastoma origin_, explores transcriptional states in human embryonic development to shed light on the origins of pediatric neuroblastoma.

## Context

The study investigates developmental processes in adrenal glands and related lineages during weeks 6â€“14 of human embryogenesis using single-cell RNA sequencing. A focus is placed on understanding cell state transitions and transcriptional programs, particularly those involving Schwann cell precursors, chromaffin cells, and sympathoblasts.

## Goals

- Identify cell states and transitions in developing adrenal glands.
- Characterize major transcriptional programs driving these transitions.
- Explore the relationship between developmental processes and neuroblastoma origins.
